mahara-blocktype-embedly
========================

This is [Embed.ly](http://embed.ly/ "Embed.ly") plugin for Mahara. Embed.ly is a service that allows you to embed content from many different social media sites without having to whitelist their iframe code.

It became part of Mahara core in 16.04 and you can use it via the "[External media](http://manual.mahara.org/en/16.04/blocks/external.html#external-media-block "External media block")" block and simply paste the code that you get from Embed.ly.

This repository is kept for Mahara instalations pre 16.04 and for historical reasons.
